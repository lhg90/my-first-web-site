<h2>Early life</h2>
<p>
    Lee was born in Seoul on May 7, 1996. He and his brother were raised by their grandparents and their father, Lee Kyung-joon, in Gangseo District, Seoul. Lee always loved puzzles and video games, often playing custom maps for Warcraft III and the MOBA Chaos during his teenage years. He discovered League of Legends in late 2011, and quickly became adept at the game. He attended Mapo High School, the same high school that fellow esports gamer Kim "Deft" Hyuk-kyu attended, but dropped out to join SKT T1 K and pursue a career in esports.
